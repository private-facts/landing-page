This is the source for the landing page on https://private-facts.org/.

We took inspiration from
  - https://palletsprojects.com/ (for the whole project and the succinct landing page.  You rock!)
  - https://haskell-miso.org/ (for the idea with the gradients)
  - https://auto.sesser.at/ (also authored by @hacklschorsch, for the fam, trying to make a 'complete' and really fast single page)
    - The CSS of that, in turn, was loosely inspired by a default Wordpress error page.  Lost the URL.
